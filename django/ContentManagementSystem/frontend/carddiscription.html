                        We’re rapidly moving towards a day and age where almost everything can be controlled by machines and one of the most revolutionary moves has been the advent of artificial intelligence. In this <span class="cl">artificial intelligence course</span>, we will talk about how to get started with AI and what exactly it is. While it began as a part of smartphones and other smart devices, AI has been increasingly taking over in other fields too. To begin with, one must understand what Artificial Intelligence is. It is an area of computer science focusing on the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans.

                        Weak: Weak AI or Narrow AI, perform only one task. The AI has to be conditioned with a set of certain answers and roles and it does not go beyond that, weak AI is thus not self-sufficient. An example of this is iOs’ Siri.
