      "There is a new function parameter syntax / to indicate that some function parameters must be specified positionally and cannot be used as keyword arguments. This is the same notation shown by help() for C functions annotated with Larry Hastingsâ€™ Argument Clinic tool.\n",

      "One use case for this notation is that it allows pure Python functions to fully emulate behaviors of existing C coded functions. For example, the built-in pow() function does not accept keyword arguments:\n",

      "def pow(x, y, z=None, /):\n",

      "len(obj='hello')  # The \"obj\" keyword argument impairs readability\n",
      "A further benefit of marking a parameter as positional-only is that it allows the parameter name to be changed in the future without risk of breaking client code. For example, in the statistics module, the parameter name dist may be changed in the future.
